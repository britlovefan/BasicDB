1.Describe any design decisions you made, including anything that was difficult or unexpected.

When I am doing this homework, it's really confusing at first when I look through all
the classes provided but don't know what to do. Even though I know the Algorithm, I do not
know how to judge a page to be leafpage or internal page..etc. Thus reading the other classes and
learning how to use the functions took a lot of time. The main idea for each exercise is simply 
writing correct recursion and pay attention that for leaf pages the pages are double-linked to
each other, thus we need to maintain the two way order. Finally, I am confused about the system
test, it shows that I fail evict page test, I double checked the BufferPool.java but didn't find
anything valuable, still don't know why my code didn't evict enough pages..

2. Discuss and justify any changes you made outside of BTreeFile.java.

I didn't make any paticular changes outside BTreeFile.java

3. Optional: How long did this lab take you? Do you have any suggestions for ways to improve it?

Took me around 20 hours. I think there should be a clear document instead of the long descriptions
on Canvas.. Hope the document would be provided according to the logic ideas. I need to read the 
descriptions multiple times to get a single exercise worked.
